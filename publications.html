          <h3>"We Found Her at the River": German Humanitarian Fantasies and Child Sponsorship in the Eastern Mediterranean in the Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries</h3>
          <p>
            This article focuses on the discursive and practical strategies of
            German humanitarian work on behalf of Ottoman Armenians in the
            Eastern Mediterranean beginning in the 1890s. Unlike their British,
            French, and US counterparts, German humanitarians, restrained by
            their government's pro-Ottoman politics, relied on mobilization and
            funding strategies that catered to an evangelical moral
            counterpublic. Pious journalism and educational efforts focused on
            individual stories and suffering and catered to both popular reading
            preferences and a devout audience, generating particular
            humanitarian fantasies, namely the pursuit of salvation through the
            rescue of distant others. These fantasies provided the raw material
            for the construction of an imagined humanitarian community
            solidified by an individualized one-to-one child sponsorship system
            involving the circulation of letters, photographs, blessings, moral
            instructions, and money. The donations of this pious Protestant
            counterpublic enabled the establishment of an enduring humanitarian
            project with the hallmarks of modern humanitarianism; it was
            international, bureaucratic, and perceived as permanent. The
            largely neglected German humanitarian efforts reveal the
            continuities between a post-World War I secular, permanent,
            institutionalized, solution-oriented humanitarian regime and the
            religious, supposedly "sporadic" missionary humanitarianism of the
            19th century, as its established practices carried over into and
            inspired the work of the interwar period.
