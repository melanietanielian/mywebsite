          <h3>The Silent Slow Killer of Famine: Humanitarian Management and Permanent Security</h3>
          <p>
            This paper argues that famine and the deliberate obstruction of
            objects indispensable to survival (OIS) must be recognized not
            merely as collateral humanitarian crises, but as potential
            first-degree famine crimes under Article II(c) of the 1949
            Genocide Convention. Drawing on South Africa's 2024 case against
            Israel before the International Court of Justice, I examine how
            humanitarian management-through blockade, inspection regimes, and
            calibrated restriction of food, water, fuel, and infrastructure-can
            function as a technology of mass violence. Situating Gaza within a
            longer continuum of siege and settler-colonial governance, I
            contend that the deliberate infliction of life-destroying
            conditions predates October 2023 and forms part of a broader regime
            of permanent security. Engaging debates in genocide studies,
            particularly the marginalization of induced famine as genocidal
            violence, this paper builds on David Marcus's concept of
            "first-degree famine crimes" and recent scholarship on postcolonial
            conflict to argue that systematic starvation should be treated as an
            actus reus of genocide when intentional and sustained. By
            foregrounding famine as a slow, often invisible form of
            destruction, the paper challenges the field's prioritization of
            direct kinetic violence and calls for a reconceptualization of
            genocide that accounts for the bureaucratic, humanitarian, and
            administrative management of death.

          <h3>"We Found Her at the River": German Humanitarian Fantasies and Child Sponsorship in the Eastern Mediterranean in the Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries</h3>
          <p>
            This article focuses on the discursive and practical strategies of
            German humanitarian work on behalf of Ottoman Armenians in the
            Eastern Mediterranean beginning in the 1890s. Unlike their British,
            French, and US counterparts, German humanitarians, restrained by
            their government's pro-Ottoman politics, relied on mobilization and
            funding strategies that catered to an evangelical moral
            counterpublic. Pious journalism and educational efforts focused on
            individual stories and suffering and catered to both popular reading
            preferences and a devout audience, generating particular
            humanitarian fantasies, namely the pursuit of salvation through the
            rescue of distant others. These fantasies provided the raw material
            for the construction of an imagined humanitarian community
            solidified by an individualized one-to-one child sponsorship system
            involving the circulation of letters, photographs, blessings, moral
            instructions, and money. The donations of this pious Protestant
            counterpublic enabled the establishment of an enduring humanitarian
            project with the hallmarks of modern humanitarianism; it was
            international, bureaucratic, and perceived as permanent. The
            largely neglected German humanitarian efforts reveal the
            continuities between a post-World War I secular, permanent,
            institutionalized, solution-oriented humanitarian regime and the
            religious, supposedly "sporadic" missionary humanitarianism of the
            19th century, as its established practices carried over into and
            inspired the work of the interwar period.

          <h3>Hungry for Change: Civilian Challenges to the State and Demands for Food</h3>
          <p>
            This chapter explores the ways in which hunger in World War I
            altered existing political structures. Civilian populations engaged
            in a complex politics of provisioning by contesting state and local
            authorities and governments' management of food. In the face of
            hunger and starvation, civilians across Europe and the Middle East
            gradually and to various degrees called their governments'
            legitimacy into question. Civilians gave voice to their demands
            through petitions, food riots, and, in some instances, rebellion
            and revolution. Women, in particular, appealed collectively to
            officials, evoking the urgent need to feed and care for their
            children. Food became central to politics as political parties
            competed in demonstrating their ability to bring food to hungry
            populations. Recognizing the crucial role of hunger to salvaging
            any popular support for continuing the war, governments responded by
            regulating food and suppressing, even violently, public protests
            demanding provisioning. The ability to supply food became an avenue
            to political success. The chapter introduces the Ottoman experience
            and provides a comparative discussion of the politicization of
            hunger. We explore how that process varied across and within the
            warscapes of Ottoman and European societies, and how hunger, as a
            catalyst, altered existing political structures and gave rise to new
            forms of political organization in response to demands by both elite
            and non-elite groups. Finally, we ask how political parties and
            organizations used food procurement and provisioning of civilians
            amidst hunger as an avenue to achieve, expand, or preserve
            political significance.
